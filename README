NotifoMail is a Python script to process piped e-mails
and post a Notifo alert, for use with e-mail forwarders such
as Exim that allow e-mail to be piped to a script.

This script requires the following Python modules:

   Notifo.py
       <http://github.com/mrtazz/notifo.py>
   Python 2.6 or SimpleJSON
       <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/>

Be sure to enter your username and API key in notifomail.cfg
before running this script - otherwise you'll just get an
error. You can also set a custom label and title, and
specify the length of the excerpt included in the
notification, in the configuration file.
